# NoamsSpotify
You start by adding your favorite artists “Lägg till artist” and bands. 
The dropdown list is coming from Spotify API. 
If the name of your favorite artist or band is not on the dropdown list Spotify do NOT have your selection. 
You can add as many artist and bands as you want. “Visa fler val” give you genre and related artists to your favorite 
artists and bands that you selected before. You can refine your result by selecting popularity 0 to 100 where 100 are most popular. 
The result can be from 1 to 100 songs. The “sök” button get you to a new view where you can see the result and play the songs on Spotify. 
The application is following Spotify API roles and in the model I’m taking much more information than necessary for future development.

At the time of publishing this application the key and Secret are working,
if you are using this code please change to your own key and secret.
